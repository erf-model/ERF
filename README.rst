Energy Research and Forecasting (ERF): An atmospheric modeling code
----

`ERF` is built upon the `AMReX <https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/>`_ software framework
for massively parallel block-structured applications.

Getting Started
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See `Getting Started <https://erf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/GettingStarted>`_ for instructions as to how to clone the ERF
and AMReX codes, and for how to build and run an ERF example.  Mimimum requirements for system software are also given there.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Documentation of the ERF theory and implementation is available `here <https://erf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ .

In addition, there is doxygen documentation of the ERF Code available `here <https://erf-model.github.io/docs/index.html>`_

Development model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See CONTRIBUTING.md for how to contribute to ERF development.

Acknowledgments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The development of the Energy Research and Forecasting (ERF) code is funded by the Wind Energy Technologies Office (WETO), part of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)'s Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy (EERE).

The developers of ERF acknowledge and thank the developers of the AMReX-based
`PeleC <https://github.com/AMReX-combustion/PeleC>`_ ,
`FHDeX <https://github.com/AMReX-FHD/FHDeX>`_ and
`AMR-Wind <https://github.com/Exawind/amr-wind>`_ codes.  In the spirit of open source code
development, the ERF project has ported sections of code from each of these projects rather
than writing them from scratch.
ERF is built on the `AMReX <https://github.com/AMReX-codes/AMReX>`_ library.
