Introduction
============

ERF solves the compressible Navier-Stokes on a Arakawa C-grid for large-scale weather modeling.

Dependencies
------------

ERF is built on `AMReX <https://github.com/AMReX-Codes/amrex>`_,
an adaptive mesh refinement software framework, which provides the underlying software infrastructure for
block structured AMR operations.
The full AMReX documentation can be found `here <https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/docs_html/>`_ and the tutorials can be found `here <https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/tutorials_html/>`_.


Development
-----------

A separate developers guide does not yet exist; along with the algorithmic description in this Users' Guide, doxygen documentation exists in place and an input file exists in `ERF/Docs` that can be build using:

::

    doxygen Doxyfile
