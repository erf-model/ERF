Filling Ghost Values
--------------------------
ERF uses an operation called ``FillPatch`` to fill the ghost cells/faces for each grid of data.
The data is filled outside the valid region with a combination of three operations: interpolation
from coarser level, copy from same level, and enforcement of physical boundary conditions.

Interpolation from Coarser level
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Interpolation is controlled by which interpolater we choose to use.  The default is
conservative interpolation for cell-centered quantities, and analogous for faces.
The paradigm is that fine faces on a coarse-fine boundary are filled as Dirichlet
boundary conditions from the coarser level; all faces outside the valid region are
similarly filled, while fine faces inside the valid region are not over-written.

Copy from other grids at same level (includes periodic boundaries)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is part of the ``FillPatch`` operation, but can also be applied independently,
e.g. by the call

::

    mf.FillBoundary(geom[lev].periodicity());

would fill all the ghost cells/faces of the grids in MultiFab ``mf``, including those
that occur at periodic boundaries.

In the ``FillPatch`` operation, ``FillBoundary`` always overrides any interpolated values, i.e. if
there is fine data available (except at coarse-fine boundary) we always use it.

Imposition of physical/domain boundary conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two primary types of physical/domain boundary conditions: those which rely only on the
data in the valid regions, and those which rely on externally specified values.

ERF allows users to specify types of boundary condition with keywords in the inputs file.
The information for each face is preceded by
``xlo``, ``xhi``, ``ylo``, ``yhi``, ``zlo``, or ``zhi``.

Currently available type of boundary conditions are
``inflow``, ``outflow``, ``slipwall``, ``noslipwall``, ``symmetry`` or ``MOST``.
(Spelling of the type matters; capitalization does not.)

For example, setting

::

    xlo.type = "Inflow"
    xhi.type = "Outflow"
    zlo.type = "SlipWall"
    zhi.type = "SlipWall"

    geometry.is_periodic = 0 1 0

would define a problem with inflow in the low-\ :math:`x` direction,
outflow in the high-\ :math:`x` direction, periodic in the :math:`y`-direction,
and slip wall on the low and high :math:`y`-faces, and
Note that no keyword is needed for a periodic boundary, here only the
specification in ``geometry.is_periodic`` is needed.

Each of these types of physical boundary condition has a mapping to a mathematical boundary condition
for each type; this is summarized in the table below.

.. _sec:dirichlet:

Dirichlet Boundary Conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ERF provides the ability to specify constant Dirichlet BCs in the inputs file. We use the following options
preceded by
``xlo``, ``xhi``, ``ylo``, ``yhi``, ``zlo``, and ``zhi``:

+------------+--------------+----------------+----------------+------------------+---------------+
| Type       | Normal vel   | Tangential vel | Density        | Theta            | Scalar        |
+============+==============+================+================+==================+===============+
| inflow     | ext_dir      | ext_dir        | ext_dir        | ext_dir          | ext_dir       |
+------------+--------------+----------------+----------------+------------------+---------------+
| outflow    | foextrap     | foextrap       | foextrap       | foextrap         | foextrap      |
+------------+--------------+----------------+----------------+------------------+---------------+
| slipwall   | ext_dir      | foextrap       | foextrap       | ext_dir/foextrap | foextrap      |
+------------+--------------+----------------+----------------+------------------+---------------+
| noslipwall | ext_dir      | ext_dir        | foextrap       | ext_dir/foextrap | foextrap      |
+------------+--------------+----------------+----------------+------------------+---------------+
| symmetry   | reflect_odd  | reflect_even   | reflect_even   | reflect_even     | reflect_even  |
+------------+--------------+----------------+----------------+------------------+---------------+
| MOST       |              |                |                |                  |               |
+------------+--------------+----------------+----------------+------------------+---------------+

Here ``ext_dir``, ``foextrap``, and ``reflect_even`` refer to AMReX keywords.   The ``ext_dir`` type
refers to an "external Dirichlet" boundary, which means the values must be specified by the user.
The ``foextrap`` type refers to "first order extrapolation" which sets all the ghost values to the
same value in the last valid cell/face.  (AMReX also has a ``hoextrap``, or "higher order extrapolation"
option, which does a linear extrapolation from the two nearest valid values.)

As an example,

::

    xlo.type                =   "Inflow"
    xlo.velocity            =   1. 0.9  0.
    xlo.density             =   1.
    xlo.theta               =   300.
    xlo.scalar              =   2.

sets the boundary condtion type at the low x face to be an inflow with xlo.type = “Inflow”.

xlo.velocity = 1. 0. 0. sets all three componentns the inflow velocity,
xlo.density       = 1. sets the inflow density,
xlo.theta         = 300. sets the inflow potential temperature,
xlo.scalar        = 2. sets the inflow value of the advected scalar

The "slipwall" and "noslipwall" types have options for adiabatic vs Dirichlet boundary conditions.
If a value for theta is given for a face with type "slipwall" or "noslipwall" then the boundary
condition for theta is assumed to be "ext_dir", i.e. theta is specified on the boundary.
If not value is specified then the wall is assumed to be adiabiatc, i.e. there is no temperature
flux at the boundary.  This is enforced with the "foextrap" designation.

For example

::

    zlo.type  = "NoSlipWall"
    zhi.type  = "NoSlipWall"

    zlo.theta = 301.0

would designate theta = 301. at the bottom (zlo) boundary, while
the top boundary condition would be a zero gradient, aka adiabatic
because no value is specified for ``zhi.theta``

We note that "noslipwall" allows for non-zero tangential velocities to be specified, as in the
Couette regression test example, in which we specify

::

    geometry.is_periodic = 1 1 0

    zlo.type = "NoSlipWall"
    zhi.type = "NoSlipWall"

    zlo.velocity    = 0.0 0.0 0.0
    zhi.velocity    = 2.0 0.0 0.0

We also note that in the case of a "slipwall" boundary condition in a simulation with non-zero
viscosity specified, the "foextrap" boundary condition enforces zero strain at the wall.

The keywork "MOST" is an ERF-specific boundary type and the mapping is described below.


It is important to note that external Dirichlet boundary data should be specified
as the value on the face of the cell bounding the domain, even for cell-centered
state data.

More general boundary types are a WIP; one type that will be supported soon is the ability
to read in a time sequence of data at a domain boundary and impose this data as "ext_dir"
boundary values using ``FillPatch``.

.. _MostBoundary:

MOST Boundaries
-------------------
Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (MOST) is used to describe the atmospheric surface layer (ASL). The implementation of MOST in ERF follows that in `AMR-Wind <https://github.com/Exawind/amr-wind/>`_, which is based on the surface layer profiles presented in `P. van der Laan, et al., Wind Energy, 2017 <https://doi.org/10.1002/we.2017>`_ and `D. Etling, "Modeling the vertical ABL structure", 1999 <https://doi.org/10.1142/9789814447164_0003>`_.

To derive MOST, it is assumed that the ASL is in a steady state and horizontally homogenous, and the turbulent stresses (:math:`\overline{u^{'}w^{'}}` , :math:`\overline{w^{'}v^{'}}`) and heat flux (:math:`\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}`) are constant with height. These assumptions can be written as:

.. math::

  \overline{u^{'} w^{'}} = const = -u^{2}_{\star},
  
  \overline{w^{'} \theta^{'}} = const = -u_{\star}\theta_{\star},

where :math:`u_{\star}` is the friction velocity and :math:`\theta_{\star}` is the surface layer characteristic temperature scale, bars indicate horizontal averages and primes indicate fluctuations. Then, based on dimensional arguments, universal similarity laws can be proposed for the vertical gradient components:
  
.. math::
	  
  \Phi_{m}(\zeta) = \frac{\kappa z}{u_{\star}} \frac{\partial \mathbf{\bar{u}}}{\partial z},

  \Phi_{h}(\zeta) = \frac{\kappa z}{\theta_{\star}} \frac{\partial \bar{\theta}}{\partial z}

where the MOST stability parameter is given by :math:`\zeta = \frac{\mathbf{z}}{L} = -\frac{\kappa z}{u_{\star}^{3}} \frac{g}{\theta_{0}} \overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}`,  :math:`L` is the Monin-Okukhov length, :math:`\kappa` is the von Karman constant (taken to be :math:`0.41`), and :math:`\theta_{0}` is the surface potential temperature.

Integration of the MOST assumption equations give the classical MOST profiles of mean velocity and potential temperature

.. math::

  \mathbf{\bar{u}}(\zeta)    &= \frac{u_{\star}}{\kappa} [ \mathrm{ln} (\frac{z}{z_0})-\Psi_m(\zeta)],

  \bar{\theta}(z) - \theta_0 &= \frac{\theta_{\star}}{\kappa} [ \mathrm{ln}(\frac{z}{z_0})-\Psi_{h}(\zeta) ]


where :math:`z_0` is a characteristic roughness height and the integrated similarity functions,

.. math::

  \Psi_{m}(\zeta) &= \int _{\frac{z_{0}}{L}} ^{\frac{z}{L}} [1-\Phi_{m}(\zeta)]d \mathrm{ln}(\zeta),

  \Psi_{h}(\zeta) &= \int _{\frac{z_{0}}{L}} ^{\frac{z}{L}} [1-\Phi_{h}(\zeta)]d \mathrm{ln}(\zeta),

are calculated analytically for stable and unstable stratifications, as indicated below.

Unstable: :math:`(-2 < \zeta < 0)`

.. math::

  \Phi_{m} &= (1-\gamma_{1}\zeta)^{-\frac{1}{4}}, \quad
  \Psi_{m}    = \mathrm{ln}[\frac{1}{8}(1+\Phi_{m}^{-2})(1+\Phi_{m}^{-1})^{2}]-2\arctan(\Phi_{m}^{-1})+\frac{\pi}{2},

  \Phi_{h} &= \sigma_{\theta}(1-\gamma_{2}\zeta)^{-\frac{1}{2}}, \quad
  \Psi_{h}    = (1+\sigma_{\theta}) \mathrm{ln}[\frac{1}{2}(1+\Phi_{h}^{-1}]+(1-\sigma_{\theta}) {\mathrm{ln}} [\frac{1}{2}(-1+\Phi_{h}^{-1})]

Stable: :math:`(0 < \zeta < 1)`

.. math::
  \Theta_{m} &= 1+\beta \zeta, \quad \Psi_{m}=-\beta \zeta,

  \Theta_{h} &= \sigma_{\theta}+\beta \zeta, \quad \Psi_{h}=(1-\sigma_{\theta})\mathrm{ln}(\zeta)-\beta \zeta

Where the constants take the values proposed in `Dyer, Boundary Layer Meteorology, 1974 <https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00240838>`_:

.. math::
  \sigma_{\theta}=1, \quad \beta = 5, \quad \gamma_{1}=16, \quad \gamma_{2}=16

Inverting the equations above, the MOST stability parameter,

.. math::
  \zeta=\frac{z}{L} = -\kappa z \frac{g}{\theta_{0}} \frac{\theta_{\star}}{u^{2}_{\star}}

is determined by the friction velocity

.. math::
  u_{\star} =\kappa \bar{u}/[\mathrm{ln}(z/z_0)-\Psi_{m}(\frac{z}{L})]

and the surface temperature

.. math::
  \theta_{\star} = \kappa (\bar{\theta} -\theta_{0})/[\mathrm{ln}(z / z_0)-\Psi_{h}(z/L)]

In ERF, when the MOST boundary condition is applied, velocity and temperature in the ghost cells are set to give stresses that are consistent with the MOST equations laid out above. The code is structured to allow either the surface temperature (:math:`\theta_0`) or surface temperature flux (:math:`\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}`) to be enforced. To apply the MOST boundary, the following algorithm is applied:

#. Horizontal (planar) averages :math:`\bar{u}`, :math:`\bar{v}` and :math:`\overline{\theta}` are computed at a reference height :math:`z_{ref}` assumed to be within the surface layer.

#. Initially, neutral conditions (:math:`L=\infty, \zeta=0`) are assumed and used to compute a provisional :math:`u_{\star}` using the equation given above. If :math:`\theta_0` is specified, the above equation for :math:`\theta_{\star}` is applied and then the surface flux is computed :math:`\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}} = -u_{\star} \theta_{\star}`. If :math:`\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}` is specified, :math:`\theta_{\star}` is computed as :math:`-\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}/u_{\star}` and the previous equation is inverted to compute :math:`\theta_0`.

#. The stability parameter :math:`\zeta` is recomputed using the equation given above based on the provisional values of :math:`u_{\star}` and :math:`\theta_{\star}`.

#. The previous two steps are repeated iteratively, sequentially updating the values of :math:`u_{\star}` and :math:`\zeta`, until the change in the value of :math:`u_{\star}` on each iteration falls below a specified tolerance.

#. Once the MOST iterations have converged, and the planar average surface flux values are known, the approach from `Moeng, Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences, 1984 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/1984JAtS...41.2052M/doi:10.1175/1520-0469(1984)041%3C2052:ALESMF%3E2.0.CO;2>`_ is applied to consistently compute local surface-normal stress/flux values (e.g., :math:`\tau_{xz} = - \rho \overline{u^{'}w^{'}}`):

   .. math::

     \left. \frac{\tau_{xz}}{\rho} \right|_0 &= u_{\star}^{2} \frac{(u - \bar{u})|\mathbf{\bar{u}}| +  \bar{u}\sqrt{u^2 + v^2} }{|\mathbf{\bar{u}}|^2},

     \left. \frac{\tau_{yz}}{\rho}  \right|_0 &= u_{\star}^{2}  \frac{(v - \bar{v})|\mathbf{\bar{u}}| +  \bar{v}\sqrt{u^2 + v^2} }{|\mathbf{\bar{u}}|^2},

     \left.  \frac{\tau_{\theta z}}{\rho} \right|_0  &= \theta_\star u_{\star} \frac{|\mathbf{\bar{u}}| (\overline{\theta} - \theta_0) +
                                                \sqrt{u^2+v^2}  (\theta - \overline{\theta}) }{ |\mathbf{\bar{u}}| (\overline{\theta} -\theta_0) } =
						u_{\star} \kappa  \frac{|\mathbf{\bar{u}}| (\overline{\theta} - \theta_0) +
                                                \sqrt{u^2+v^2}  (\theta - \overline{\theta}) }{ |\mathbf{\bar{u}}| [  \mathrm{ln}(z_{ref} / z_0)-\Psi_{h}(z_{ref}/L)] }

   where :math:`\bar{u}`, :math:`\bar{v}` and :math:`\overline{\theta}` are the plane averaged values (at :math:`z_{ref}`) of the
   two horizontal velocity components and the potential temperature, respectively, and
   :math:`|\mathbf{\bar{u}}|` is the plane averaged magnitude of horizontal velocity (plane averaged wind speed). We note a slight variation in the denominator
   of the velocity terms from the form of the
   equations presented in Moeng to match the form implemented in AMR-Wind.

#. These local flux values are used to populate values in the ghost cells that will lead to appropiate fluxes, assuming the fluxes are computed from the turbulent transport coefficients (in the vertical direction, if applicable) :math:`K_{m,v}` and :math:`K_{\theta,v}` as follows:

   .. math::

      \tau_{xz} = K_{m,v} \frac{\partial u}{\partial z}
   
      \tau_{yz} = K_{m,v} \frac{\partial v}{\partial z}
      
      \tau_{\theta z} = K_{\theta,v} \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial z}.

   This implies that, for example, the value set for the conserved :math:`\rho\theta` variable in the :math:`-n\mathrm{th}` ghost cell is

   .. math::

      (\rho \theta)_{i,j,-n} = \rho_{i,j,-n} \left[ \frac{(\rho\theta)_{i,j,0}}{\rho_{i,j,0}} - \left. \frac{\tau_{\theta z}}{\rho} \right|_{i,j,0} \frac{\rho_{i,j,0}}{K_{\theta,v,(i,j,0)}} n \Delta z \right]
