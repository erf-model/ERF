Coupling To AMR-Wind
====================

The simplest form of coupling is one-way, file-based coupling. With this approach, an
ERF simulation is run and output files with relevant simulation data are stored at
regular time intervals. Once the ERF simulation is complete, an AMR-Wind simulation
begins, using the ERF output files as time-dependent boundary conditions or forcing.

1D File-based coupling
----------------------

The 1D file-based coupling scheme is based on the Time-Height Profile Assimilation
Technique proposed by `Allaerts et al. <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10546-020-00538-5>`_
In this approach, the time evolution of the vertical profile of the horizontal
velocity components and potential temperature at a particular position from the
mesoscale simulation is saved, and a forcing term is added to the microscale simulation
to indirectly assimilate the mesoscale data at the microscale.
The output files generated by ERF are NetCDF files of a format compatible with the
`AMR-Wind implementation <https://github.com/shashankNREL/amr-wind/blob/sy/almForceWrf/amr-wind/wind_energy/ABLWrf.cpp>`_
of this form of coupling.

We note that the solution variables in ERF are

.. math::

    (\rho, \rho u, \rho v, \rho w, \rho \theta)

while those in AMR-Wind are

.. math::

    (u, v, w, T, p)

We convert the variables from conservative to primitive form prior to saving the
output files.

The following parameters control the generation of 1D column output files in ERF. To
use this capability, the user must install the `NetCDF library
<https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/>`_ and link to it at compile time, which can be done
by setting `USE_NETCDF = TRUE` in the GNUMakefile for ERF.

*  You should specify either **erf.output_int** or **erf.output_per**, but not both.

2D File-based coupling
----------------------

For 2D file-based coupling to AMR-Wind, vertical planes are saved from an ERF simulation
to define inflow boundary conditions for AMR-Wind.  These files are in native-AMReX format and
contain the AMReX data structure known as a :cpp:`BndryRegister`.
These files are specifically meant to be read by AMR-Wind, which is also AMReX-based, or ERF itself.

To generate the boundary data files for each of the four planes,
the following (or similar) should be added to the input file:

.. code-block:: none

  erf.output_bndry_planes = 1
  erf.bndry_output_planes_interval = 2
  erf.bndry_output_start_time = 0.0
  erf.bndry_output_planes_file = "BndryFiles"
  erf.bndry_output_var_names = temperature velocity density
  erf.bndry_output_box_lo = 256. 256.
  erf.bndry_output_box_hi = 768. 768.

The above inputs will output boundary planes of data at x=xlo, x=xhi, y=ylo and y=yhi, where
xlo and ylo are defined by :cpp:`bndry_output_box_lo` and
xhi and yhi are defined by :cpp:`bndry_output_box_hi`. Note that the selected lo and hi values must
be interior to the first and last cell centers on the coarse grid (i.e., at least one half cell width
from the boundary). Except if the domain is periodic
in that direction, any location up to and including the domain boundary may be chosen.
In this case the variables that are
written are temperature, velocity and density, and they are written every 2 coarse time steps starting at
:cpp:`bndry_output_start_time` which is 0 in this case.

We also have the functionality in ERF to read in these types of files;
for this one would add the following (or similar) line to the inputs file:

.. code-block:: none

  erf.input_bndry_planes = 1
  erf.bndry_file = "BndryFiles"
  erf.bndry_input_var_names = density temperature velocity

When run with these inputs, ERF will read in the time sequence of files contained in the folder :cpp:`BndryFiles`,
and perform time interpolation as necessary. The only assumption about the times associated with the files
is that the start and end times of the current simulation
lie in the time period covered by the files in :cpp:`BndryFiles`.  Within :cpp:`BndryFiles` there is an
ascii file :cpp:`time.dat` which contains the (originating) timesteps and physical times associated with each of the files.

It is assumed at this point that the physical domain of the simulation reading the files is exactly the physical
domain specified by :cpp:`bndry_output_box_lo` and :cpp:`bndry_output_box_hi` when the files were written.  If not, ERF will
abort with an error message.

We note that the boundary plane data will only be used on faces identified in the inputs file as inflow faces, i.e. if
we specific inflow/outflow in the x-direction, and periodic in the y-direction, as below, then only the "xlo" boundary data
from :cpp:`BndryFiles` will actually be used.

::

    geometry.is_periodic = 0 1 0

    xlo.type = "Inflow"
    xhi.type = "Outflow"
