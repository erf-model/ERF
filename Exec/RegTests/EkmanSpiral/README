This problem setup is for the classic Ekman Spiral test. The Ekman spiral problem 
tests Coriolis and geostrophic forcing as well as the computation of the stress term 
internally and at no-slip walls.

A description of the problem, including the exact solution, can be found at 
https://exawind.github.io/amr-wind/developer/verification.html#ekman-spiral .

When the executable here is run with inputs_custom, the solution is initialized
in ERF_prob.cpp from the exact solution.

When the executable here is run with inputs_ideal, the solution is initialized
from the wrfinput_ekman_d01 file, thus this is also a test of ERF's ability to 
initialize from WPS "ideal" files.

When the executable here is run with inputs_input_sounding, the solution is initialized
from the input_sounding_file,  thus this is also a test of ERF's ability to 
initialize from input soundings.
