This problem setup is designed to test the advection and diffusion of scalar
fields in a relatively simple flow.

There are seven inputs files in this directory, each doing a slightly different test.

Below are their names in the CI tests, the corresponding inputs files here, and a brief description.

ScalarAdvectionDiffusionUniformU  inputs_adv_diff_uniformU

   Advection and diffusion of a spherical blob in a uniform velocity field (100,0,0)

ScalarAdvectionShearedU           inputs_advect_shearU

   Advection of a spherical blob in a uniform shearing velocity field (8 log( (z+z0)/z0 ) / log ( (zref+z0)/z0 )
   with z0 = 0.1 and zref = 80 in a domain 8x8x8

ScalarAdvectionUniformU          inputs_advect_uniformU

   Advection of a spherical blob in a uniform velocity field (10,5,0)

ScalarDiffusionGaussian           inputs_diffuse_Gaussian

   Diffusion of a spherical blob of scalar

ScalarDiffusionSine               inputs_diffuse_sine

   Diffusion of a scalar initialized as sin(x)

RayleighDamping                  inputs_test_rayleigh 

   This tests Rayleigh damping.  The problem is initialized as in the shear flow case, then
   Rayleigh damping is applied with a target mean profile of (2,1,0).
