This problem setup is for classic Couette flow.  The domain is periodic in the x- and y-directions
and has no slip walls on the top and bottom.  The velocity is specified to be 
(2,0,0) (for inputs_couette_x) or (0,2,0) (for inputs_couette_y) at the top wall.

The Couette flow and Poiseuille flow problems primarily test the implementation of the
viscous terms, in particular the discretization at the boundaries.
