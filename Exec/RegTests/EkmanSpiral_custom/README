This problem setup is for the classic Ekman Spiral test. The Ekman spiral problem 
tests Coriolis and geostrophic forcing as well as the computation of the stress term 
internally and at no-slip walls.

A description of the problem, including the exact solution, can be found at 
https://exawind.github.io/amr-wind/developer/verification.html#ekman-spiral .

The version of the Ekman spiral test in this directory initializes the solution
from the exact solution.  See https://erf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/RegressionTests.html
for plots of the solution and a convergence study.
