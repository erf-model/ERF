This problem setup is for classic Poiseuille flow.  The domain is periodic in the x- and y-directions
and has no slip walls on the top and bottom. The flow is driven by a pressure gradient in the x- or 
y-direction.

The Couette flow and Poiseuille flow problems primarily test the implementation of the
viscous terms, in particular the discretization at the boundaries.
