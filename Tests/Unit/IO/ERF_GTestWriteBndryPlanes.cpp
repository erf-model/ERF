// Contract of WriteBndryPlanes::rows_to_keep, which decides how much of an existing time.dat a run
// continues from. A boundary-plane series is a time.dat of "step time" rows, one per plane, read
// back by erf.input_bndry_planes, which stops on a step or time that does not increase. A restart
// keeps the rows up to and including its own step (the run before it wrote those planes) and drops
// the later ones, which the restart writes again; rows that cannot belong to the run being
// continued (not increasing, later than the restart, or at the restart step at another time) end
// the kept rows. A fresh start keeps none. The CTests
// ABL_BndryPlanes_* check the same behaviour end to end against a run without a restart.
